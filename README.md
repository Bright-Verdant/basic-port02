## introduction 

This is a proof of concept portfolio website for prospective employers to view my coding projects.

## features

Name and Photo: Upon loading the portfolio, you will be presented with my name and a recent photo or avatar.

Navigation Links: I included both links to other pages and a scrolling UI which will bring users to other sections of the website.

MY work: Clicking on the link to the section about work will scroll the UI to a section displaying titled images of applications. Each application's image is sized proportionately, and the first application is larger than the others for prominence.

Application Deployment: By clicking on the images of the applications, you will be directed to the deployed version of the respective application. This allows you to interact with the developer's work and gain firsthand experience.

Responsive Layout: The portfolio website is designed with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Whether you resize the page or view it on various screens, the layout will adjust accordingly for optimal viewing experience.

## Usage

To use the employee portfolio website, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in a web browser of your choice.

Once the portfolio loads, you will see the developer's name and a recent photo or avatar.

Use the navigation links to explore different sections of the portfolio. Clicking on a link will scroll the UI to the corresponding section.

To view the developer's applications, click on the link to the section about their work. This will display titled images of the applications, with the first application's image being larger in size.

Click on the images of the applications to be directed to the deployed versions, where you can interact with them.

## responsive-layout

The portfolio website is designed with a responsive layout to ensure optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes. The website will adapt and reposition elements to fit the viewport without compromising usability or readability. Whether you resize the page or access it on different devices, the portfolio will adjust accordingly for a seamless experience.
